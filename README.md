# Nordic Health Hackathon Iceland 2019
This is the winning project for the first prize of the Arion Bank challenge and the second prize of the Digi.me challenge on this edition of the [Nordic Health Hackathon](https://nordichealthhackathon.com/).

## Idea
Salud enables humans to track, interpret and manage their personal health.

Salud tackles two challenges: European citizens often do not use their free preventive medical check-ups and - although feeling healthy - are not actually living a healthy lifestyle.


Our developed mobile app retrieves real medical data, current activity data (e.g. FitBit) and credit card transaction categories to give individuals health check-up and vaccination recommendations, view and order medical prescriptions and book doctor appointments. These will allow users to actually make use of all this data that they collect themselves or have already to meaningfully improve their healthcare.

To develop this application, we used data about vaccinations, appointments, prescriptions provided by the Iceland Health Ministry, Fitbit data provided through digi.me and credit card transaction data from Arion Banki.
